# Web3-Gaming-Unity

When tasked with describing the future state of mobile blockchain games, I first had to look at the current state of web3 gaming. If you have had any exposure to the blockchain gaming ecosystem, you have probably heard the words Axie Infinity, Blankos Block Party and the one that started it all CryptoKitties. Okay, so, honestly, this is a nothing burger. So what differentiates the current centralised game development from decentralised games development.

# NFT's


![NFTWTF-1080x720](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/681817/135502611-174c0589-d890-41d9-805b-fcb0a4bb237b.jpg)


Here's is a snippet from Wikipedia for those that are new to the concept.
"A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unit of data stored on a digital ledger, called a blockchain, that certifies a digital asset to be unique and therefore not interchangeable.[1] NFTs can be used to represent items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of digital files. However, access to any copy of the original file is not restricted to the buyer of the NFT. While copies of these digital items are available for anyone to obtain, NFTs are tracked on blockchains to provide the owner with a proof of ownership that is separate from copyright."

This uniqueness is what makes NFT's in decentralised gaming so interesting. If you have played games as I have, you may have imagined this character you built up and the possibility of using that character in another game and or blockchain. Well, in this series of tutorials on building blockchain games with the ChainSafe Unity Gaming SDK. We will do a bit of both:

We are going to need to download the SDK and set up our development environment.
We will walk through the SDK and get you up to speed on everything you need to know and the ChainLegos needed to create your decentralised games.
We will lay the foundation for our endless runner game that will start as a WebGL browser game, "the current state of decentralised gaming," and then port that game to a mobile experience.

Installing the SDK and configuring our development environment

We will begin by downloading the SDK from GitHub and then creating a starting project to get the players to get the account information from our MetaMask wallet and display it on screen.

If you have followed the tutorial and seen your account information, you have successfully configured ChainSafe Unity gaming. Follow the link below and get your POAP for completing this stage coming soon.


ChainSafe Gaming SDK prefabs.

Next, we will go over the different prefabs or ChainLegos we will be using to build out our decentralised game. The team created these prefabs with all the functionality you need to build out your game. The only editing you will need is to update your smart contract address and network that you deployed your contract.
